      <h1>People Who Inspire Me</h1>
      <p>
        Contrary to most designers—or people in general—most of the people I
        take inspiration from are my friends and/or other artists I've
        interacted with one on one. I am but the sum of my friendships and the
        people I've met over the years. Here are a few links to people who've
        changed my life for the better:
      </p>
      <div id="inspirations">
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://alextomlinson.com/">Alex Tomlinson 🐦</a></li>
          Alex is an incredible artist and friend. The font on this site—Nay
          Aug—was designed by him. You can usually find him drawing birds,
          designing typefaces, or working on pigeon post.
          <li><a href="https://www.bitsofwonder.co/">Kasra 📝</a></li>
          Kasra writes on Substack a lot. He has an incredible ability to speak
          to the heart in a way I've only seen in Anton Chekhov's writing.
          <li><a href="https://proper-code.com/">Santi Grau 🇪🇸</a></li>
          Santi is...Santi? There's really no other way to describe him. I first
          met him while I worked at Tesla. He works on interactive art
          installations but saying just that would do a disservice to the
          culmination of his work. He is an artist in every sense of the word.
          <li><a href="https://www.alannatran.com/">Alanna Tran 🎨</a></li>
          Alanna is an incredibly talented designer I met through playing
          minecraft with my friends Angelo and Raven. You should check out her
          comics. She has an ability to pack an incredible amount of emotion and
          detail into her artwork that I don't think I've ever seen anyone come
          close to.
          <li><a href="https://www.ravenmo.info/">Raven Mo 📮</a></li>
          I once had someone I just met mention Raven as "Famous Type Designer
          Raven Mo." Raven is one of the most talented designers I've ever met.
          She works on type design, iconography, UI design, and anything you
          could think on. Pure. Distilled. Creativity. If you like typography,
          check her work out.
          <li><a href="https://ngelo.xyz/">Angelo 🇵🇷</a></li>
          Angelo constantly uplifts and tries to help everyone around him. When
          I say that, an idea in your head might pop up, but I can assure you
          it's a disservice to the amount he cares. Very rarely in life will you
          meet someone like Angelo, and that's very unfortunate. He's a software
          engineer at Railway, and a cracked one at that.
          <li><a href="https://www.chris-wang.com/work">Chris Wang ™</a></li>
          Designed by Chris Wang ™. Chris Wang Design ™.<br />
          Very rarely do you see people so versed in classical design tools. I
          genuinely think if there were a world where Figma and the entire Adobe
          suite didn't exist, you could give Chris a single 2b pencil without an
          eraser, and he'd be just fine. His photography is incredible, check it
          out.
          <li><a href="https://evazhang.ai/#currently">Eva Zhang 🧮</a></li>
          If you're interested in the application of intelligence, AI as a tool
          to solve world problems, AI agents, crypto, or matcha, Eva is the
          person to talk to. She is unwaveringly herself, something most people
          aren't. More people should be like Eva.
          <li>
            <a href="https://amirbolous.com/">Amir Bolous 👨‍💻</a>
          </li>
          Amir started Rabbitholeathon, which is where both him and I first
          truly hung out 1 on 1. He's constantly building things, constantly
          learning, and I think what I appreciate the most about him is that he
          cares, a lot.
          <li>
            <a href="https://yev.bar/">Yev 🤓</a>
          </li>
          Yev is crazy, and I love him dearly. He's currently working on
          <a href="https://lsd.so/">LSD</a>
          (not the drug!!!) If you're interested in a company that can turn any
          URL into a SQL-compatible API check his work out.
        </ul>
        <p>
          I also have a ton of people who've inspired me who don't have websites
          (or any online presence!!!) Here are a few of those individuals:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pranav, Noah, Alec, Jake, дана, Rahul, Aidan, Andrew, Arman, John,
            Felix, Mark, Gabe, Miguel, Leon, Justina, Ryan, Parneeth, Nico, JZ,
            Paws, Long, Liam, James, Jordan, Josh, Linden, Brian, Adam, Brian,
            Patrick, Xander, Aidan, Ashley, Ben, Erdem, Mitchell, Olivia, Molly,
            Ray, Aislyn, Cody, Sooj, Vince, Adam, Dave, Remy, Kohei, Sofi,
            Daniel, Aidan, Alex, Jenifer, Kevin, Arman, Ashely, Brad, Christine,
            Skyler, Michael, Alex, Yi, Izaan, Spruce, Evelyn, Christina, Adwait,
            Mathew, Julie, and many more that I need to add...
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Lastly, this entire site is inspired by my friend Cody. His love for
          websites along with creating the most memory efficient programs have
          forever changed how I think about my art. I will forever cherish our
          walks around the design center.
