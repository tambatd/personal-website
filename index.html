      <h1>Hey, I'm Devendra ❀</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a designer. For me that translates into working on iconography,
        building out design systems, making interactive experiences (video
        games, web apps, art exhibitions), or writing c++ code.
      </p>
      <p>
        More importantly, being a designer translates into being someone who
        cares a lot. Someone who cares about the end to end experiences you have
        with everything around you, including this site.
      </p>

        Most of my design inspiration comes from the early works of Naoto
        Fukasawa and Yugo Nakamura. I prefer minimalism in the sense of being
        functional and not empty. Modern minimalism makes me want to vomit.
