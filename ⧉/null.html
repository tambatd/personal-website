      <h1>NULLPTR EXCEPTION</h1>
      <p>
        the following are random thoughts i've accrued by existing over the
        years. I'm forgoing a lot of "design" on this portion of the site.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          fall in love with something man, pursue an art form, find the upper
          bounds of your abilities, fall in love with the world and everything
          everyone's created, work tirelessly to the point of insanity to create
          something, anything, that when someone looks at, they also fall in
          love
        </li>
        <li>
          this world we exist in, exists for one sole reason. individuals all
          across the world had things they cared about so much, that they wanted
          to share that beauty with others. the moment you stop doing that is
          the moment humanity’s beauty dies, and humanity with it
        </li>
        <li>
          the day after a loved one's death is fascinating, just an empty
          sickness in ones stomach, akin to what i'd imagine the opposite of the
          feeling of "butterflies" to be. i wonder if the opposite of death is
          love, and if death means the end, does love (creation) signal the
          beginning
        </li>
        <li>
          my mom often asks why i'm not friends with the other asian kids in my
          religious community, and earnestly it's that every time i interact
          with them, they're all playing incredibly low-stakes status games and
          making me constantly prove that i deserve to exist
        </li>
        <li>
          freshman year of college i cold emailed 100+ PlayStation designers
          asking for help on how not only to be a better designer but also how
          to enter the industry, and only one person emailed me back, and he's
          now my design mentor and one of my closest friends<br /><br />in life,
          a lot of people aren't going to take bets on you, but there will be
          those who do, and you should double down on them and hold them tight,
          and ignore everything else
        </li>
        <li>
          the tech sphere is constantly addicted to quantifying their
          intelligence in comparison to others, and at all points in these
          conversations these discussions are fundamentally useless, because the
          only thing that matters is just doing things<br /><br />i've seen
          people several magnitudes smarter than me dedicate their life to
          playing nyt minigames all day and working in sales at google
        </li>
        <li>
          i look around at all the incredibly talented engineers i'm working
          with on a day to day, and most of their backgrounds are so varied.
          part of me wonders if what truly separates mediocre engineers from
          great ones isn't intelligence, but willingness to be in the trenches
          learning
        </li>
        <li>
          my roommate went to a party, brought back a girl (they’re currently
          making out) and I spent the past 8 hours looking at muji designs
        </li>
        <li>
          i have a hard time understanding the idea that you learn way more by
          working at a startup than at a FAANG. feel like i've learnt more abt
          software engineering and design working at FAANG over the past 3
          months, than my time working at a startup for over a year
        </li>
        <li>
          some of my favorite design projects are ones that are meant to be
          viewed by only one person and no one else. there's something innately
          special in crafting something for just one person to see, that
          everything was designed around them
          <br /><br />
          we are only as beautiful as the individual love we give one-another
        </li>
        <li>
          the idea that quality art is produced by those who are depressed or
          mentally ill in some way is true to an extent, but i think it’s truth
          lies in the fact that art for a lot of these people exists as the one
          sole thing that makes them feel happy/alive to an extent
        </li>
        <li>
          you shouldn’t be able to viciously critique art unless you yourself
          have created an art pieces that’s been viewed by others
        </li>
        <li>
          as an artist, you have the moral duty to create more art. i’ll see a
          tweet along the lines of, “i’m giving up on drawing” and earnestly,
          give up. let this world be polluted with low quality artwork, let the
          children consume the worst, all because you decided to give up.
        </li>
      </ul>
